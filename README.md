# Promamec Salles et Resources Management System

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Promamec Resource Management System (PRMS) repository! This project was developed as part of my internship at Promamec and aims to provide a comprehensive solution for managing rooms and resources within the company. PRMS streamlines the allocation and monitoring of company assets, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The PRMS is designed with a user-friendly and intuitive interface, making it easy for employees to manage and locate resources.

- **Reporting**: Generate reports on room occupancy, resource allocation, and usage trends. Gain insights into resource utilization for informed decision-making.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel**: The backend of the PRMS is built using the Laravel PHP framework, providing a robust and secure foundation for the application.

- **MySQL**: The database system used for data storage and management.

- **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap**: Front-end development is implemented with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
